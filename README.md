## What is this

CineScope is a front‑end web app. It lets you:

* Search by title across movies, series, and games
* Filter by type, year, or genre
* View results in a card layout
* Open About, Contact, and Feedback modals
* Use it on mobile, tablet, and desktop

---

## Tech stack

* HTML5 and CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Font Awesome icons
* CSS Grid for layout
* Modular modal system

---

## Quick start

* Mobile‑first layout.
* Search can connect to OMDb or TMDb with minimal changes.
* Forms use native HTML5 validation.
